# PiConsole

A work-in-progress RP2040 based portable video game console.

Currently it has the basic schematic for the Waveshare RP2040 Zero board, the 3d parts and a simple hard coded game (for testing the hardware).

Next steps are creating the virtual machine compiler and runtime for game development.
